All these agents allow users to generate detailed reports on any topic of their choosing as long as the data is publicly accessible. However, there are three major critical barriers that enterprises face using these tools today:  · Security: A large percentage of enterprise data must remain private on-premise and thus inaccessible to existing Deep Research tools. Speed: Deep Research tools today are often very slow and cannot be used for quick iteration and urgent use cases. Cost: Because deep research agents consume many more tokens, the costs for running these systems is increasing exponentially, especially with OpenAI.",

Although generative AI model inference cannot run on CPUs, their generalization ability across various scenarios has significantly improved compared to traditional visual models. Another advantage of using multimodal models for document intelligence is the ability to incorporate textual information into document layouts. A representative work this year, M2Doc [Reference 23], integrates BERT into a vision-based Encoder-Decoder architecture, enhancing the identification of semantic boundaries for text and paragraphs. In the upcoming year of 2025, research based on Encoder-Decoder architectures is expected to advance further.

While the chorus hasn’t moved on entirely, the focus in 2025 has shifted from large language models (LLMs) to advancements in the ostensibly autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents ushering in the future of work. Despite a momentary surge in gen AI interest around Deepseek’s R1, which promised significant performance improvements over ChatGPT, the dominant innovation narrative in 2025 is the AI agent. Media coverage highlights the promises of innovation, automation and efficiency agents will bring, but how much of the conversation is click-hungry hype?",
