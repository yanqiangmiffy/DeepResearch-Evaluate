Medical LLMs are being utilized to enhance diagnostics, streamline patient interactions, and improve overall clinical workflows. Read on to discover how these advancements are transforming the healthcare industry. There is a critical need for guidance on integrating large language models and generative AI in healthcare and medical practices using technologies such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLFH), few-shot learning, and chain-of-thought reasoning, according to a PubMed study. For example, large language models can be useful in clinical note summarization and achieve higher accuracy.",

Large language models could revolutionize the way organizations deliver healthcare and drive patient engagement. When trained on robust health datasets, these models can play a crucial role in enhancing patient care through data-driven insights. In this guide, learn about the potential and challenges of large language models in healthcare, and how organizations can experiment responsibly with this powerful tool. Large language models (LLMs) are deep learning models trained on a large neural network. In essence, LLMs can take a large sequence of text and figure out what it means — fast. So, it makes sense that LLMs are transforming various industries, processing vast amounts of information quickly and freeing up employees’ time for other important tasks.",

That seems very recent and directly related to the topic.\n\nThen, there's an article from Stanford HAI about large language models in healthcare, also from 2024.\n\nAnother one is from aisera.com, dated December 2023, discussing large language models in healthcare.\n\nThere's also a paper from mdpi.com with the same title as the first one, but it might be a different version or the same paper published in a journal.\n\nAdditionally, there's a list of the best 10 large language models in healthcare for 2025, which might be useful for understanding current trends.\n\nThere are also articles from arcadia.io, another mdpi.com paper, a scoping review from PMC and ScienceDirect, and a piece from The Lancet.\n\nSince the user is looking for research on the application of large language models in medical question answering and auxiliary diagnosis, I think the review papers and scoping reviews would be particularly useful.\n\nLet me first look into the arXiv paper: \"Large Language Models in Healthcare and Medical Domain: A Review\"\n\nI can use the browse action to get more details from this paper.\n\nBut wait, arXiv papers are usually PDFs, and the browse action might not directly access the PDF content. Let me check the URL: https://arxiv.org/html/2401.06775v2\n\nOh, it's an HTML version, which is great because browse can handle HTML content.\n\nSo, I can call browse with the URL and a query to extract relevant information.\n\nWhat should be my query? Since the paper is a review, it probably covers various aspects. I need to find sections or parts that specifically talk about medical question answering and auxiliary diagnosis.\n\nPerhaps I can ask for \"applications in medical question answering\" or \"use cases in auxiliary diagnosis\".\n\nAlternatively, since it's a review paper, it might have sections dedicated to different applications.\n\nLet me first try to get the abstract or the introduction to understand the structure.\n\nWait, actually, in the search result, there's already a description that says: \"This comprehensive survey delves into the functionalities of existing LLMs designed for healthcare applications, elucidating the trajectory of their development, starting from traditional Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) to the present state of LLMs in healthcare sector. First, we explore the potential of LLMs to amplify the efficiency and effectiveness of diverse healthcare applications, particularly focusing on clinical language understanding tasks.
